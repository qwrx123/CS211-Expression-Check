 This program takes in any expression with numbers of any integer and returns the result
 results only work if the end result and the running total are within an integer
 if not you will get an overflow error, but it wont crash
 unary negatives work (5*-3 is valid) and unary negatives stick to the number (-5^2 = 25)
 unary negatives don't stick to parenthesis so -(5+3) is -1 * (5+3)
 Program will repeat when given an invalid expression as well as when an answer has been found
 I believe i found every edge case including overflowing integer limits
 as well as negative factorial
 Mod 0 is valid just like in windows calculator
 The running total must be within an int for a answer to be given 2147483648-1 gives overflow
