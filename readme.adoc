This program takes in any expression with numbers of any integer and returns the result
results only work if the end result and the running total are within an integer
if not you will get an overflow error, but it wont crash
unary negatives work (5*-3 is valid) and unary negatives stick to the number (-5^2 = 25)
unary negatives dont stick to parenthesis so -(5+3) is -1 * (5+3)
Program will repeat when given an invalid expression as well as when an answer has been found
